# PORTFOLIO_INTENT.md

## Purpose

This portfolio exists to show **how I think**, not what I know.

It is not a catalogue of projects, tools, or achievements.
It is a quiet, intentional experience that reveals how I reason,
how I make decisions under constraints,
and how I learn when things don’t work.

The goal is not to impress everyone.
The goal is to resonate deeply with a few.

If someone spends time here, they should leave with a clear sense of:
- how I approach problems
- how I deal with uncertainty
- how I balance craft, systems, and reality

## Who This Is NOT For

This portfolio is NOT for:
- People looking for a quick scan of buzzwords or frameworks
- People who value speed over depth, polish over clarity
- People who expect a traditional “hero → projects → contact” layout

This portfolio intentionally filters.
If it feels quiet, slow, or unconventional, that is by design.

---

## Core Experience Model

This site is a **single-page immersive experience**.
It behaves like a **state machine**, not a document.

There is:
- No traditional navigation
- No scrolling-based storytelling
- No pages in the conventional sense

Instead, the interface reconfigures itself based on **thought selection**.

Only one concept can be active at a time.

## Defined States

### 1. Awakening
This state exists to establish tone and intent.
It slows the visitor down and invites curiosity before content.

### 2. Systems
This state exists to show how I think in structures, trade-offs,
and long-term consequences rather than isolated features.

### 3. AI
This state exists to show my understanding of AI behaviour,
limitations, and assumptions — not hype or surface-level usage.

### 4. Failure
This state exists to build trust through honesty,
showing what didn’t work and how that shaped my thinking.

### 5. Craft
This state exists to highlight attention to detail,
invisible decisions, and respect for the user experience.

### 6. Curiosity / Chaos
This state exists to explore ambiguity, experimentation,
and how I operate when problems are undefined or messy.

## Project Selection Rules

- Maximum of 5 projects
- Every project must prove something about how I think
- At least one project must include meaningful failure
- At least one project must be system-heavy
- At least one project must involve ambiguity or uncertainty

Projects are selected for **insight**, not scale or popularity.

---

## Project Narrative Frame

Every project is expressed through the same five lenses:

1. The Obsession  
   What problem wouldn’t let go

2. The Constraint  
   What limited the solution space

3. The Decision  
   What I chose, and what I intentionally sacrificed

4. The Failure  
   What broke, didn’t scale, or proved incorrect

5. The Insight  
   What permanently changed the way I think

Understanding always comes before visuals.

## Explicit Exclusions

This portfolio will NOT include:
- Testimonials
- Metrics or vanity numbers
- Certifications or badges
- A timeline of experience
- Blog posts
- A long personal biography
- Loud animations or decorative motion
- Framework or tool name-dropping without context

Anything that does not serve clarity is removed.

---

## Experience Principles (Non-Negotiable)

1. No animation without meaning  
2. Silence and empty space are allowed  
3. Text before visuals  
4. Nothing competes for attention  
5. Restraint communicates confidence  

If a design choice feels impressive but unnecessary, it is removed.
If something feels quiet but honest, it stays.

---

## Final Intention

This portfolio is a signal, not a performance.

If someone leaves remembering how it felt,
rather than what it listed,
then it has succeeded.
